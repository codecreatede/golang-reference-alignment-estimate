# golang-reference-alignment-estimate 

- This package deals with the genome or the gene alignment and you can define a reference sequence for the same.
-  By defining the reference sequence, you are using that sequence against the other sequence for the calculation of the alignment estimates.

```
[gauravsablok@ultramarine]~/Desktop/codecreatede/golang/golang-reference-alignment-estimate% \
go run main.go -h
This is used to estimate the alignment according to the specified sequence

Usage:
  flags [flags]

Flags:
  -a, --alignment string     alignment file (default "alignment file to be used for the estimate")
  -h, --help                 help for flags
  -s, --refsequence string   reference sequence (default "sequence to be used as reference")
```
